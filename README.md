# World.Execute(me); Console Video in C#



I wrote this code like a 2 years ago, I apoligize if its messy. It rushed bit, but I'm happy with the results
I tried my best to atleast make it modular for the different animation acommapnied by the Console, You can go through with
the different animation in Lyrics.cs

==Do note you need NAudio.Wave if your planning to use this, or you can just remove it from program.cs==
==Also some dir are hardcoded so you might need to change or make a dir, especially for the readfile() function==
