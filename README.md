# World.Execute(me); Console Video in C#



I wrote this code like a year ago, I apolagize if its messy. Its rushed bit, but I'm happy with the results

I tried to atleast make it modular for the different char animation acommapnied by the Console, You can go through with
the different animation in **Lyrics.cs**

==Do note you need NAudio.Wave if your planning to use this, or you can just remove it from program.cs==

==Also some dir are hardcoded so you might need to change or make a dir, especially for the **readfile()** function==
